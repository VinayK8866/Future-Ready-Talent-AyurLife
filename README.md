# What problem this website is Solving?

Our Ayurveda is day-by-day forgetting in our Indian culture and it is being stolen to other countries like the US. It is because of a lack of knowledge among Indian people about Ayurveda. My website provides a lot of information about Ayurveda. 

# More about this website

Ayurveda is considered one of the oldest traditional systems of medicine accepted worldwide. However, Indians are abandoning their culture in favour of Western culture. It is because of a lack of knowledge among Indians. So to provide good information, this website would help budding scholars, researchers, and practitioners gain deeper perspicuity of traditional systems of medicine, facilitate strengthening of the commonalities, and overcome the challenges towards their global acceptance and harmonisation with such medicinal systems. There is also a bot that answers Ayurvedic-related questions. So, if anyone has a doubt about Ayurveda, they can chat with the bot.
