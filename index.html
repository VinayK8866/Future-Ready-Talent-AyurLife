        <h2>What is Ayurveda?</h2>
        <p>Ayurveda is considered by many scholars to be the oldest healing science. In Sanskrit, Ayurveda means “The Science of Life.” Ayurvedic knowledge originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and is often called the “Mother of All Healing.” It stems from the ancient Vedic culture and was taught for 
            many thousands of years in an oral tradition from accomplished masters to their disciples. Some of this knowledge was set to print a few thousand years ago, but much of it is inaccessible. The principles of many of the natural healing systems now familiar in the West have their roots in Ayurveda, 
            including Homeopathy and Polarity Therapy.</p>
        <p>Everything in the universe - dead or alive - is connected. If your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance, you get sick. 
            Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and seasonal change, age, and your emotions.
            Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth.
            These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They control how your body works. They are Vata dosha (space and air); Pitta dosha (fire and water); and Kapha dosha (water and earth).
            Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. It's believed that your chances of getting sick -- and the health issues 
            you develop -- are linked to the balance of your doshas.</p>
        <h2>The Three Doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta) in Ayurveda</h2>
        <p>Energy plays an important role in our lives. We need energy and vitality to be able to lead our life in a healthy way. In fact, our life force or Prana is believed to be nothing but energy. We get energy from nature through the sun and other natural elements. Ayurveda is the science of life. This ancient wellness system is a natural system of healing. Ayurveda believes that there are primary functional energies in our bodies that are aligned with the elements of nature. These three forces of energies are known as <b>Doshas (Kapha - Vata  - Pitta)</b>. They are a very important concept in Ayurveda. The entire system of Ayurvedic healing is directly related to the three Doshas. The article explains all about these forces of nature and how they impact your health and life.</p>
        <h2>The Elements and the Doshas</h2>
        <p><b>Vata, Pitta and Kapha</b> are the three types of Doshas or primary functional energies in the body. Vata is related to wind. Pitta is related to fire and Kapha relates to water. These Doshas are related to the elements of nature. It is commonly believed that there are five elements of nature. These five elements are: <br> 

            <b>1. Earth(Prithvi)<br></b> 
            
            <b>2. Air (Vayu)</b><br>
            
            <b>3. Water (Jala)</b><br>
            
            <b>4. Fire (Teja)</b><br>
            
            <b>5. Space (Aakash)</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Vata Kapha Pitta have a strong relationship with the elements of nature. The relationship is defined as given below:<br> 
            
            Vata Dosha is related to air and space.<br>
            
            Pitta Dosha is related to fire and water.<br>
            
            Kapha Dosha is related to earth and water.

        <h2>Yoga in Ayurveda</h2>
        <p>There is more to yoga and Ayurveda than just asanas and medicinal plants ! Both of them encompass all of human life and the entire universe. Both Yoga and Ayurveda are historically closely related and have developed in tandem with each other since ancient times. They have diverged in modern times, over the last hundred and fifty years, particularly outside of India, in which Yoga without Ayurveda was for a long time the norm. However, Yoga and Ayurveda are becoming reconnected again, not only in India but across the globe. Therefore, it would not be wrong to say that theirreintegrationis the reintegration of the circle of consciousness,life, healing and transformation! Therefore, it is important to understand the respective roles of Ayurveda and Yoga in the Vedic system.</p>
